2. **Clear Objectives**: Measurable outcomes desired
3. **Stakeholder Identification**: Who's involved/affected
4. **Timeframe**: Implementation timeline
5. **Resource Constraints**: Available assets/limitations

### Example Well-Formed Query:
"Design a 3-year transition plan for a 500-hectare mixed grain farm in Saskatchewan, integrating hemp rotation for climate stabilization, incorporating Cree traditional knowledge, targeting 30% increase in soil carbon while maintaining economic viability through dual EHDC/traditional income streams."
