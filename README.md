# Conscious Evolution Framework

Welcome to the Conscious Evolution Framework, a hub for regenerative intelligence and cosmic stewardship. This repository integrates research, technology, economics, and implementation strategies to transition humanity toward a regenerative, multiplanetary future.

## Overview
This repository serves as the central hub for the Conscious Evolution Framework, encompassing:
- **Research**: Foundational scientific papers on biodiversity, climate, and microbial intelligence.
- **Technology**: Tools like Continuous Thought Machine (CTM), Polydimensional AI, and QSAAT.
- **Economics**: Ecosystem Health-derived Digital Currency (EHDC) with a three-token system.
- **Implementation**: Trials like Longford Property and hemp-based climate tools.
